## Our Goal is to answer this question: Is there a difference between the alcohol consumed between the row you choose to sit in??

# Introduction

The research question is this: Is there a difference in the average amount of alcohol consumed per week by students who sit in row 1, row 2, or row 3 of the UCDavis classroom.

$H_0$ There is no difference on the average amount of alcohol consumed per week based on seating row.

$H_A$ There is a difference on the average amount of alcohol consumed per week based on seating row.

# Methods

We are trying to predict alcohol consumption based on seating row. 

Data Form UC Davis: 

alcohol ~ Seat

alcohol is a numerical variable

Seat is a categorical variable

So we use the Numerical~cat helper file.

# Description

## Graphical Description

## Now with ggplot - first select the basic data

```{r}
basicCN <- ggplot(davisdata,aes(y=alcohol,x=Seat))
```
## Now add in boxplot

```{r}
basicCN + geom_boxplot()
```
  
  
### get fancy  

```{r}
basicCN + geom_boxplot(notch=TRUE,outlier.color = "red") + stat_boxplot(geom ='errorbar') + labs(title="Fancy notch boxplot \n with 2 lines")
```
